# [auth](https://github.com/wazo-pbx/wazo-auth)

wazo-auth is the authentication server used by the Wazo platform.

wazo-auth is used to:

* create and store tokens
* validate tokens and permissions
* create and manage users
* create and manage user groups
* create and manage policies (named group of permissions).
* bootstrap third party authentication for Microsoft and Google
* store tokens for Google and Microsoft

## Schema

* wazo-oauth2 is used to complete the OAuth 2.0 token creation process for third party authentications

## API documentation

The REST API for wazo-auth is available [here](http://developers.wazo.io/api/authentication.html).

The bus events are defined [here](https://github.com/wazo-pbx/xivo-bus/blob/master/xivo_bus/resources/auth/events.py).

The database tables are defined [here](https://github.com/wazo-pbx/wazo-auth/blob/master/wazo_auth/database/models.py).

## Policies

A policy is a list of ACL templates that is used to generate the ACL of a token. Policies
can be created, deleted or modified using the REST API.

### ACL templates

ACL templates use [jinja2 templates](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/templates/#). Each backend is responsible of supplying a list of variables
to the template engine for rendering.

A backend supplying the following variables:

```javascript

    {"uuid": "fd64193f-7260-4299-9bc2-87c0106e5302",
     "lines": [1, 42],
     "agent": {"id": 50, "number": "1001"}}
```

With the following ACL templates:

```

    confd.users.{{ uuid }}.read
    {% for line in lines %}confd.lines.{{ line }}.#:{% endfor %}
    dird.me.#
    {% if agent %}agentd.agents.by-id.{{ agent.id }}.read{% endif %}
```

**Note**: when using `for` loops to create ACL, make sure to add a `:` separator at the end of
          each ACL

Would create tokens with the following ACL:

```
    confd.users.fd64193f-7260-4299-9bc2-87c0106e5302.read
    confd.lines.1.#
    confd.lines.42.#
    dird.me.#
    agentd.agentd.by-id.50.read
```

## Tokens

A token is used to identify and authorize all HTTP queries done on the wazo-platform. Each token has an expiration
and can be revoked by the user.

The token should be added to each subsequent HTTP request using the 'X-Auth-Token' HTTP header.

## Service Authentication

Wazo services expose more and more resources through REST API, but they also ensure that the access
is restricted to the authorized programs.


### Call flow

Here is the call flow to access a REST resource of a Wazo service:

1. Create a username/password (also called service_id/service_key) with the right ACLs.
2. Create a token with these credentials.
3. Use this token to access the REST resource requiring the ACL

add a schema here http://documentation.wazo.community/en/latest/_images/service_authentication_workflow.png

* Service: Service who needs to access a REST resource.
* wazo-{daemon}: Server that exposes a REST resource. This resource must have a required ACL.
* wazo-auth: Server that authenticates the `Service` and validates the required ACL with the token.

Wazo services directly use this system to communicate with each other, as you can see in their Web
Services Access.
