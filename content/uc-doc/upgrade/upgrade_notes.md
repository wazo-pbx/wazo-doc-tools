## <a name="20-07"></a>20.07

- The TLS configuration has been deprecated on the following services. You should always use NGINX
  to proxy communication with wazo-platform services. To follow this change, the listen address has
  been changed to 127.0.0.1 by default.

  - wazo-confd
  - wazo-dird
  
- The API of the service `wazo-phoned` is now available at `http://wazo.example.com/api/phoned/` (and its HTTPS equivalent). It is still available at `http://wazo.example.com:9498/`. You can disable the new endpoint in `/etc/nginx/locations/http{,s}-enabled`.

  to proxy communication with wazo-platform services. To follow this change, the listen address has
  been changed to 127.0.0.1 by default.

  - wazo-auth

## <a name="20-05"></a>20.05

-   `wazo-amid`, `wazo-plugind` and `wazo-dird` http configuration section have been moved onto the
    rest_api section, eg:

        rest_api:
          https:
            listen: <ip>
            port: <port>
            certificate: </path/to/cert>
            private_key: </path/to/key>

    becomes:

        rest_api:
          listen: <ip>
          port: <port>
          certificate: </path/to/cert>
          private_key: </path/to/key>
- The TLS configuration has been deprecated on the following services. You should always use NGINX
  to proxy communication with wazo-platform services. To follow this change, the listen address has
  been changed to 127.0.0.1 by default.

  - wazo-amid

- There is now an API to manage SIP transports. This means that the transport of a SIP endpoint is not
  predefined anymore. If you relied on the fact that a SIP endpoint used the transport `wss` to know
  whether or not it is a WebRTC endpoint you should change your logic to check if `webrtc` equals to `yes`.

Consult the [20.05
Tickets](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10011&version=10077) for
more information.

## <a name="20-04"></a>20.04

-   The PJSIP `Global` and `System` configuration options are now configured
    using `/1.1/asterisk/pjsip/global` and `/1.1/asterisk/pjsip/system`.
    Options added to the `/1.1/asterisk/sip/general` that used to be mapped to
    one of these sections have been migrated to the new API and the mapping
    from chan_sip to chan_pjsip has been removed for those 2 sections.

Consult the [20.04
Tickets](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10011&version=10072)
for more information.

## <a name="20-03"></a>20.03

-   The email template in wazo-auth now use the incoming HTTP request
    host and port to fill the template instead of the service discovery
    configuration. If you have a customized template that
    inconditionally uses the port it should be modified for cases where
    the port is not used.
-   The `xivo-aastra-2.6.0.2019` phone provisioning plugin has been
    removed. The decision was made after it was discovered that the
    firmware was nowhere to be found. If you still want to use it, it is
    in the `archive` phone plugin repository.

Consult the [20.03 Tickets](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10011&version=10069) for more information.

## <a name="20-02"></a>20.02

Consult the [20.02 Tickets](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10011&version=10067) for more information.

## <a name="20-01"></a>20.01

-   The default protocol configured for consul is now `HTTP` instead of
    `HTTPS` since it's only available on `localhost`. The `HTTPS`
    remains available via the port `8501`.

Consult the [20.01 Tickets](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10011&version=10065) for more information.

## <a name="19-17"></a>19.17

-   The default Ansible installation installs the development version of
    Wazo Platform. If you have not changed the
    `wazo_distribution_upgrade` variable, all the subsequent upgrades
    will stay on the development version. This is the expected behavior,
    but it was not visible in the installation procedure. To make your
    Wazo Platform use the stable version, use the following command:

        wazo-dist -m pelican-buster

    This command will take effect at the next Wazo Platform upgrade.

-   `wazo-dird` phone plugins have been migrated to `wazo-phoned`. If
    you used the phone routes from `wazo-dird` directly, you must use
    the new routes in `wazo-phoned`.
-   The conference rooms created in Wazo 18.03 or before (using asterisk
    `meetme` module) will not work anymore because they rely on DAHDI.
    If you were still using those conference rooms, you must create new
    conference rooms using the conferences API or the `wazo-ui`
    interface.
-   `DAHDI` is not longer a mandatory dependency of Wazo: it will not be
    installed on new installs anymore. Upgraded Wazo Platform will keep
    DAHDI installed if it was configured in
    `/etc/asterisk/dahdi_channels.conf`. Otherwise, DAHDI will be
    removed. To install or remove DAHDI manually, see
    [Enabling Chan Dahdi](/uc-doc/administration/hardware/chan_dahdi).
-   Some dependencies have been removed from the `asterisk` package. If
    you used one of the following modules you must install the
    `wazo-asterisk-extra-modules` to keep using those modules. Note that
    all modules listed here are disabled by default on Wazo. You have to
    manually modify `/etc/asterisk/modules.conf` to use them.
    -   `app_jack`
    -   `cdr_pgsql`
    -   `cdr_radius`
    -   `cdr_tds`
    -   `cel_radius`
    -   `cel_tds`
    -   `chan_also`
    -   `chan_console`
    -   `chan_mgcp`
    -   `chan_motif`
    -   `chan_oss`
    -   `chan_phone`
    -   `chan_skinny`
    -   `chan_unistim`
    -   `res_calendar_caldav`
    -   `res_calendar_ews`
    -   `res_calendar_exchange`
    -   `res_calendar_icalendar`
    -   `res_calendar`
    -   `res_snmp`
    -   `res_xmpp`

## <a name="19-16"></a>19.16

-   `xivo-amid-client` has been renamed to `wazo-amid-client`
-   `wazo-auth` http configuration section have been moved onto the
    rest_api section, eg:

        rest_api:
          https:
            listen: <ip>
            port: <port>
            certificate: </path/to/cert>
            private_key: </path/to/key>

    becomes:

        rest_api:
          listen: <ip>
          port: <port>
          certificate: </path/to/cert>
          private_key: </path/to/key>

-   The default value for Asterisk PJSIP configuration parameter
    `rtptimeout` has been set to 7200 seconds on new installs only. The
    change was done to automatically delete ghost calls that might get
    stuck. If you wish to modify this value, use the
    `/asterisk/sip/general` endpoint in `wazo-confd` API.

Consult the [19.16 Tickets](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10011&version=10054) for more information.

## <a name="19-15"></a>19.15

-   We have standardize the stevedore entry point namespace for our
    python client. If you have custom plugins, Be sure to use the full
    client name for the namespace. (e.g. `auth_client.commands` -->
    `wazo_auth_client.commands`)
-   The directed call pickup extension `*8XXXX` has been disabled by
    default on new installations, because it made it possible for any
    user to pickup any other user, including users for whom it should
    not be possible. This does not apply to upgrades, but if you wish to
    disable this feature, you can do it with `wazo-confd`
    `/extensions/features` API endpoint.

Consult the [19.15 Tickets](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10011&version=10046) for more information.

## <a name="19-14"></a>19.14

-   A new version (v2) of websocket protocol has been created. See
    [Wazo WebSocket](/uc-doc/api_sdk/websocket) for more
    information

    The v1 is now deprecated and should not be used anymore. Also it
    does not return the attribute `msg` in all payloads as it was always
    empty.

-   `xivo-confgend` has been renamed to `wazo-confgend`
    -   The custom configuration files have been moved to
        `/etc/wazo-confgend/conf.d`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
    -   The log file has been renamed to
        `wazo-confgend.log`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
    -   The plugin entry points have been renamed from `xivo` to `wazo`.
        Plugins enabled in custom configuration files should use the new
        name.
    -   The entry point identifier has been changed from `xivo_confgend`
        to `wazo_confgend`. If you have developed custom plugins for
        confgend you should use the new identifier in your
        `setup.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"}.
-   `xivo-confgend-client` has been renamed to `wazo-confgend-client`
    -   If you used the `xivo-confgen` CLI tool you will now have to use
        `wazo-confgen`
-   If you are upgrading a Wazo that was originally installed in 18.03
    or earlier, the old directory configuration is now replaced with a
    new profile `default` for each tenant. The migration of the old
    directory configuration must be done manually, since there is no way
    to automatically detect the tenant for each directory configuration.
    To allow this migration, the old configuration is dumped in
    `/var/backups/xivo/dird_sources.yml` during the upgrade to Wazo
    Platform 19.14. The administrator must then recreate the directory
    configuration manually using the API or web interface.
-   There is a [known bug](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/browse/WAZO-1254) that will
    remove pre-recorded sound files provided by the `xivo-sounds-*`,
    .e.g `xivo-sounds-fr-ca`. If you had installed one of these packages
    manually, you need to install the corresponding `wazo-sounds-*`
    package manually, e.g. `wazo-sounds-fr-ca`. Upgrades to Wazo >=
    19.15 are not affected by this bug.

-   **Debian has been upgraded from version 9 (stretch) to 10
    (buster).** Please consult the following detailed upgrade notes for
    more information:

- [Debian 10 (Buster) Upgrade Notes](/uc-doc/upgrade/upgrade_notes_details/19-13/buster)

-   `xivo-amid` has been renamed to `wazo-amid`
    -   The custom configuration has been moved to
        `/etc/wazo-amid/conf.d/`.
    -   The log file has been renamed to `wazo-amid.log`.
    -   The NGINX proxy has been recreated in
        `/etc/nginx/locations/https-enabled/wazo-amid`.

General
-------

-   All administration interfaces `xivo-web-interface` and
    `wazo-admin-ui` have been removed. They are replaced by `wazo-ui`.
    To install it, run the following command after the upgrade:
    `apt install wazo-ui`.
-   The Wazo Client and `xivo-ctid` have been removed.
-   `wazo-dird` is now configured using its REST API. The previous
    configuration files have been removed and a new profile `default` is
    now created for each new tenant.
-   [Entity]{.title-ref} concept has been replaced by
    [Tenant]{.title-ref}. The previous concept was not completely sealed
    and we have fixed it with the [tenant]{.title-ref}.

    -   Existing devices are migrated automatically to the tenant of
        their first associated line. If a device is in autoprov mode, it
        will be migrated to the default tenant. See
        [Introduction](/uc-doc/system/backup_restore#intro-provisioning) for more
        information on how device tenants are handled.
    -   Agents are now multi-tenant. Agents created using the rest API
        that were not logged into a queue and that were not associated
        to a user have been deleted.
    -   Skills are migrated to the tenant of the agent with whom they
        are associated. If a skill was not associated with an agent, it
        has been deleted.
    -   All the existing skill rules have been associated to the tenant
        of the first queue found in the database. If there were no queue
        configured in the system, the skill rules have been deleted.
    -   Call logs are now multi-tenant. Each call log that cannot be
        associated to a tenant has been associated to the `master`
        tenant. Also for all call logs created after the upgrade, if the
        tenant cannot be extracted from call informations, they will be
        associated to the master tenant.

- [Migration of sound files to tenants](/uc-doc/upgrade/upgrade_notes_details/19-03/sounds)

    -   We needed to do some guesswork for ambiguous resources that
        shared other resources from different entities. These resources
        have been migrated to the most logical tenants. However, it may
        be possible that they are still associated to resources that
        were migrated to different tenants. When this happens, you need
        to fix them manually and to make sure to remove the affected
        resources or to recreate them in the right tenants. Even if they
        still work, these configurations are invalid and shall be
        removed automatically in future upgrades. Therefore, you should
        review the following resources:

        > -   call permissions
        > -   ivr
        > -   moh
        > -   pagings

<!-- -->

-   User authentication has been updated with the following changes:
    -   User passwords cannot be returned in plain text anymore.
    -   Users export (export CSV) cannot export passwords anymore.
    -   Processing time to import users (import CSV) has been increased
        significantly if the field `password` is provided.
    -   Fields `username` and `password` in `wazo-confd` API `/users`
        are now ignored for authentication and must be considered
        invalid. They have been replaced by `wazo-auth` API.
    -   Field `enabled` for `wazo-confd` API `/users/<user_id>/cti` is
        now ignored for authentication and must be considered invalid.
        It has been replaced by `wazo-auth` API.
-   Invalid user email address (e.g. `invalid@`) have been deleted
    automatically during upgrade.
-   All agents will have to log out and log back in to receive calls
    from queues. You may use the command
    `wazo-agentd-cli -c "relog all"` to do this.
-   The procedure for custom certificates, especially for Let's Encrypt
    certificates, has been simplified. See
    [Certificates for HTTPS](/uc-doc/system/https_certificate).
-   People using the `xivo-aastra-2.6.0.2019` will have to upgrade to
    plugin version 1.9.2 or later
-   `wazo-provd` now uses YAML configuration. The defaults can be
    overridden in the `/etc/wazo-provd/conf.d/`{.interpreted-text role="file"} directory. See [Configuration Files](/uc-doc/system/configuration_files).
-   The provisioning option `dhcp-integration` is now enabled by default. There is no REST API to
    disable this feature.
-   Call pickups that have been created using the REST API or
    `wazo-admin-ui` have the interceptors and targets mixed up. Since
    call pickups created using the "orange" web-interface did not have
    that bug, we could not fix the existing configuration automatically.
    Faulty call pickups have to be edited and users moved from
    interceptors to targets and vice versa.
-   Since the feature for managing certificates from the "orange"
    web-interface is gone, all certificates must now be managed
    manually. The directory to access to certificates is
    `/var/lib/xivo/certificates`{.interpreted-text role="file"} and is
    not backuped or synchronized for HA anymore.
-   If a group or queue was named `general`, then it has been renamed
    with one or more suffix `_` (e.g. `general_`). The name `general` is
    not allowed anymore.
-   `xivo-sysconfd` is now asynchronous by default. This implies that
    changes made via the API or via a web interface may take some time
    to take effect after the action. If you rely on Asterisk being
    reloaded when configuring resources. See
    `sysconfd-configuration` to set the
    `synchronous` option to `true`.
-   Upgrade from version older than 15.01 are not supported anymore.
-   If a custom context (created using the REST API or wazo-admin-ui)
    was named with the following names, then it has been renamed with
    one or more suffix `_`. Also if the context name had invalid
    characters (i.e. space), then invalid characters are replaced by
    `_`. All custom configuration should be updated to reflect the
    changes.
    -   [authentication]
    -   [general]
    -   [global]
    -   [globals]
    -   [parkedcalls]
    -   [xivo-features]
    -   [zonemessages]
-   The `wazo-google` and `wazo-microsoft` plugins have been copied to
    the `wazo-auth` and `wazo-dird` repo. You **must** uninstall that
    plugin if you installed it manually from source to avoid conflicts
    between the supported version and the legacy version.

Asterisk related
----------------

-   Asterisk version has been updated:

- [Asterisk 15 to 16 Upgrade Notes](/uc-doc/upgrade/upgrade_notes_details/18-12/asterisk_16)

-   Wazo now uses `res_pjsip` instead of `chan_sip`.
    -   All custom lines with interface `SIP/something` must be changed
        to `PJSIP/something`
    -   All custom dialplan using the `SIP_HEADER` dialplan function
        must be changed to `PJSIP_HEADER` function
    -   The `SIPAddHeader` and `SIPRemoveHeader` dialplan application
        must be changed to `PJSIP_HEADER` function
-   The username for all SIP devices in `autoprov` mode has been
    changed. Devices in `autoprov` mode will have to be restarted before
    entering the provisioning code.
-   Asterisk configuration files can now be customized in the
    `/etc/asterisk/*.d/`{.interpreted-text role="file"} directories. If
    you had custom configuration in
    `/etc/asterisk/*.conf`{.interpreted-text role="file"} you will have
    to create a new file in the corresponding `*.d`{.interpreted-text
    role="file"} directory to use your customized configuration. Files
    named `*.conf.dpkg-old`{.interpreted-text role="file"} will be left
    in `/etc/asterisk`{.interpreted-text role="file"} if this operation
    is required. See [Asterisk configuration files](/uc-doc/system/configuration_files#asterisk-configuration) for more details.
-   The skill rules internal names have been changed to use the format
    `skillrule-<id>`. If you were using custom dialplan with a
    preprocess subroutine to handle your skill rules, we recommend
    removing it and using the REST API (see
    [Apply Skill Rule Sets](/uc-doc/contact_center/skillbasedrouting#skill-apply)). If you really want to
    keep it, you must change the name used in the variable
    `XIVO_QUEUESKILLRULESET` to use the new format.
-   Asterisk logs (`/var/log/asterisk/full`{.interpreted-text
    role="file"}) now contain milliseconds
-   The `tenant_name` variable has been removed from the call recording
    templates in favor of the `tenant_uuid`. If the `tenant_name` was
    used in the directory name, a symlink can be used to keep the same
    name.

        role="file"}
    -   Entrypoints for custom Python plugins have been renamed to
        `<new_service_name.*`{.interpreted-text role="file"}.
    -   Environment variable for `wazo-upgrade` has been renamed from
        `XIVO_CONFD_PORT` to `WAZO_CONFD_PORT`.
    -   All users that are logged in Wazo, i.e. who have an
        authentication token, must logout and log back in, to apply the
        change of authorizations names (ACL).
-   The following Python clients have been renamed. If you were using
    the old one in your Python code you should use the new one.
    -   `xivo-agentd-client` to `wazo-agentd-client`
    -   `xivo-confd-client` to `wazo-confd-client`
    -   `xivo-dird-client` to `wazo-dird-client`

-   `xivo-agentd-cli` has been renamed to `wazo-agentd-cli`
-   `xivo-provd-cli` has been renamed to `wazo-provd-cli`
-   `xivo-dhcpd-update` has been renamed to `wazo-dhcpd-update`
-   The fail2ban jail was renamed from `asterisk-xivo` to
    `asterisk-wazo`.
-   Chat messages, user and device presences are now handled by
    `wazo-chatd` instead of `wazo-calld` and `MongooseIM`.

    > -   All chat messages will be deleted after the upgrade.

-   The `/var/lib/xivo/sounds`{.interpreted-text role="file"} directory
    has been migrated to `/var/lib/wazo/sounds`{.interpreted-text
    role="file"} and the directory `/var/lib/xivo`{.interpreted-text
    role="file"} is considered deprecated. Please update all custom
    references to this path.

Developers
----------

-   The following daemons have been updated to Python 3. If you have
    written or installed a custom plugin for those daemons, you must
    ensure that the plugins are compatible with Python 3.
    -   `wazo-auth`
    -   `wazo-calld`
    -   `wazo-confd`
    -   `wazo-dird`
-   The following backends in `wazo-auth` have been removed. All
    following users have been migrated to `wazo_user` backend.
    -   `xivo_admin`
    -   `xivo_service`
    -   `xivo_user`
-   `wazo-auth` API to implement a `wazo-auth` backend has been changed
    in 18.02. The compatibility code that allowed old backends to keep
    working has been removed.
    -   The `get_ids` method has been removed.
-   ACL templating has been modified: when generating multiple ACLs with
    one template, ACL were separated with `n`. They are now separated
    with `:` (colon). `n` is not interpreted anymore. You should hence
    replace any `n` with `:` in your ACLs.
-   `wazo-provd` now uses `wazo-auth` to authenticate all requests and
    uses HTTPS. It is no longer possible to deactivate authentication.
    Therefore, all calls to the REST API will need to be made using
    HTTPS and a token generated with `wazo-auth`.
-   `wazo-provd-cli` has been updated to remove the username and
    password command line arguments since they are no longer used.
-   The configuration of `rest_api` section for `wazo-confd`
    configuration file has changed. See [wazo-confd changelog
    19.06](https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-confd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1906)
    for more information.
-   All API related to `cti profile` have been removed. See [wazo-confd
    changelog
    19.08](https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-confd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1908)
    for more information.
-   Creating a resource using the REST API now requires the
    `Wazo-Tenant` HTTP header when the created resource is not in the
    same tenant as its creator.
-   Authentication policies now have a `tenant_uuid` and the
    relationship between tenants and policies has been removed. If you
    did use policies with tenant association, the policy is now
    associated to one of its tenant. This feature is not used yet in
    Wazo, so most likely you are not affected.
-   `wazo-confd` REST API does not allow to manage `call-logs` anymore.
-   `wazo-provd` API URL has been updated to remove the `provd` prefix
    when present and add the API version number, which is `0.2`. All
    affected services and `wazo-provd-client` have been updated.
    Example: `/provd/dev_mgr` is now `/0.2/dev_mgr` and `/api/api.yml`
    is now `/0.2/api/api.yml`

-   If you have a [custom certificate configured](/uc-doc/system/https_certificate),
    you will need to add a new symlink for wazo-upgrade:

```ShellSession
# mkdir -p /etc/wazo-upgrade/conf.d
# ln -s "/etc/xivo/custom/custom-certificate.yml" "/etc/wazo-upgrade/conf.d/010-custom-certificate.yml"
```

-   Default passwords for phones' web interfaces have been changed. You
    can change the password in
    `Configuration --> Provisioning --> Template device`.
-   The default NAT option in General SIP settings has been
    automatically changed from `auto_force_rport` to
    `auto_force_rport,auto_comedia`. This makes NAT configuration easier
    but has no impact on environments without NAT.
    -   In the rare cases where you want to keep `nat=auto_force_rport`
        you must explicitly change this value in the administation
        interface `Services --> IPBX --> General Settings --> SIP Protocol` in tab
        [Default]. See [Asterisk sip.conf
        sample](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/blob/15.1.1/configs/samples/sip.conf.sample#L869)
        for more informations.
-   The NAT configuration of every SIP line and SIP trunk has been
    automatically changed from `nat=auto_force_rport` to nothing, so
    that they inherit this setting from the General SIP settings.

-   For wazo-auth backend developers: The API to implement a wazo-auth
    backend has changed. Old implementations have to be updated. If the
    BaseAuthenticationBackend class was used as a base class for the
    backend the [get_metadata]{.title-ref} method from the base class
    will use [get_ids]{.title-ref} to generate the result of
    [get_metadata]{.title-ref}.
    -   The [get_ids] method has been removed.
    -   The [get_metadata] method has been added.

-   **Debian has been upgraded from version 8 (jessie) to 9 (stretch).**
    Please consult the following detailed upgrade notes for more
    information:

- [Debian 9 (stretch) Upgrade Notes](/uc-doc/upgrade/upgrade_notes_details/18-01/stretch)

-   If you *did not* setup a custom X.509 certificate for HTTPS (e.g.
    from Let's Encrypt), the certificate will be regenerated to include
    SubjectAltName fields. The two main reasons are Chrome compatibility
    and avoiding a lot of log warnings. This implies that you will have
    to add a new exception in your browser to access the Wazo web
    interface or services like [Unicom](https://phone.wazo.community).
-   If you *did* setup a custom X.509 certificate for HTTPS (e.g. from
    Let's Encrypt), you will have to add a link to the wazo-auth-cli
    configuration using the following command.

```ShellSession
# ln -s "/etc/xivo/custom/custom-certificate.yml" "/etc/wazo-auth-cli/conf.d/010-custom-certificate.yml"
```

-   The Python API for xivo-confd plugins has been updated to reflect
    Python API of other daemons. If you have created a custom xivo-confd
    plugin, you must update it:

```Python
class Plugin(object):

   def load(self, core):
       api = core.api
       config = core.config
```

```Python
class Plugin(object):

   def load(self, dependencies):
       api = dependencies['api']
       config = dependencies['config']
```

-   The web interface no longer validates the queue skill rules fields
    added in
    `Services --> Call Center --> Configuration --> Skill rules`. If a rule is wrong, it will appear in the
    Asterisk console.
