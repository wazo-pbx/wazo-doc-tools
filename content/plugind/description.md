## What is a plugin

A plugin is a set of additions made to a custom Wazo platform installation to add a new functionality.

### What can be done with a plugin

Wazo plugins allow a third party to add almost anything to Wazo. Most of our services have extension points that can be used together to create a complete feature as a plugin.

* Add configuration files to wazo services in /etc/*/conf.d/
* Add configuration files and dialplan files to Asterisk
* Reload services to complete the installation
* Extend wazo services using the available extension points

  * wazo-auth
  * wazo-calld
  * wazo-confd
  * wazo-dird
  * xivo-confgend

## How it works

Given a plugin source wazo-plugind will generate a debian package using the information provided in the `wazo` directory.

The `plugin.yml` adds data that can be used to generate the debian packaging files.
The `rules` file is used to add actions during the installation and uninstallation process.

The generated Debian packages have the following names `wazo-plugind-<plugin name>-<plugin namespace>`
