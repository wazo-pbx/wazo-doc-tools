# Install the Wazo Platform

Wazo Platform is an Open Source project allowing to build carrier grade programmable IP communication infrastructures. You can pick and choose the components you need to build your infrastructures with class 5 features like audio and video calls, chat, call centers, conferences, voicemail, etc., and class 4 features like security, routing, load balancing, etc. You can augment the platform and integrate it with your subscription and billing capabilities or any value-added services like Speech to Text, A.I. or sentiment analysis. These communication infrastructures can be deployed and scaled on bare metal, virtual machines or containers.
